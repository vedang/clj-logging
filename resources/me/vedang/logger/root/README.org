#+title: Structured Logging in Clojure

* What is this project?
This is a template Clojure project showcasing how to configure Log4J2 as the logging backend properly, to output structured logs from the project. These logs can then be consumed by a collector like [[https://vector.dev/][Vector]] and forwarded to a tool like [[https://grafana.com/oss/loki/][Loki]] for visualisation.

To install the template, run the following code:
#+begin_src sh :eval no
  clojure -Sdeps '{:deps {io.github.vedang/clj-logging {:git/sha "TBD"}}}' -Tnew create :template me.vedang/logger :name yourprojectname/logger
#+end_src

Note that this assumes you have installed ~deps-new~ as your ~new~ "tool" via:

#+begin_src sh
clojure -Ttools install-latest :lib io.github.seancorfield/deps-new :as new
#+end_src
